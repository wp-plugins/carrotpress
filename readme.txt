= Is it a good idea to use this plugin on a site with many users? =
**No.**

= Why Not? =
Users don't expect to see carrots in their checkboxes or radio buttons so don't mess with their expectations. I [considered it once](http://mrwweb.com/messing-with-expectations-and-ui-feedback-needed/) and thought better of it thanks to the counseling of a few good friends.

International Carrot Day (April 4), National Eat Your Vegetables Day (June 17, USA only), World Vegetarian Day (October 1), and World Vegan Day (November 1).
